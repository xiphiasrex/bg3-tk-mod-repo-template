## Usage
1. Create a project in the Baldur's Gate 3 Toolkit
2. Clone this repo to a non-protected directory (not in something like Program Files)
   1. You can give a name to the local repo to reflect the specific mod
   2. You will need to create a fork or change the remote to be able to push changes
3. Update properties at the top of `repo-setup.py` and save
4. Run `python repo-setup.py` from command prompt, or double-click on script
5. Going forward you should be able to commit/push/pull/etc. like any other git repo
